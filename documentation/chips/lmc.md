# Little Man Computer (LMC)

[LMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) is a very simple, fake architecture, used to teach students.

This implementation reads assembly directly and assembles it to machine code.

It supports all opcodes, including the `OTC` opcode that prints ASCII to the terminal.
